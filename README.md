# Foreign Exchange Rate Prediction Using Deep Learning

In this project, we will demonstrate the application of two different variants of RNNs i.e., Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Artificial Neural Network ANN as base model for prediction of the foreign exchange rate (i.e., USD/INR).
